# Project Name

Movie Poster

## Description

I wanted to create a site where users are able to see details about their favorite movies and update them if wanted.
At the home page, you can click on a movie poster to be taken to the details page where you can read the description, and
also have a list of genre's associated with that film.

If you would like to update the title or description for any film, simply click the "edit" button from the details page. There
you will be able to change the title and/or description. Click save to save your changes, or cancel to return to the previous
details page.

This project was created with React and also used redux, sagas, bootstrap, postgresql, and reactstrap.

In the future I would like to work on some more styling. I would like the cards to display in columns and rows instead of a single
vertical line.
